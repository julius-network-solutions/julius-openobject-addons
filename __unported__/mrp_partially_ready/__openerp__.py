You can now start the production order if you have the partially the components.
================================================================================

This module will add a new state into the production order "Partially ready to produce".
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:


    * You've got 1 product "Main product".
    * This "Main product" is composed of 1 product "A" and 2 products "B".
    * You need to produce 10 pieces of "Main product".
    * By default the system will put the production order "Ready" when you have 10 products "A" and 20 products "B".
    
This module will also give you the possibility to start a production order partially.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:

    * You have 100 "Main product" to make.
    * You've got all the components ready.
    * You want to start 50 now, and 50 later
    * Click on the new button "Start Partially".
    * This will split the production order into 2 orders.
    
Now with this module:
---------------------

    * The production order will be "Partially ready to produce" when you've got at least the quantity to produce 1 "Main product", ie 1 product "A" and 2 products "B".
    * You will be able to start partially a production order when totally ready.
