    This module will allow to split moves when there are some moves which are partially available.
    E.g.: You have to send 10 PCE, but right now you only got 8 PCE ready.
    By default OpenERP will tells you that this move is not ready when you will check the availability of this move.
    
    This module will split the move into 2 moves:
        - One of 8 PCE ready.
        - One of 2 PCE not ready.
    
    Then when you will check the availability again in this Picking, and the 2 last PCE are ready and the 8 PCE not send yet,
    This will merge these to move into only one.
